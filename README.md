#What is this?

This Python script exports images from the Photos App in Mac OS X. It works also with really old Photos Apps like in Mac OS X Yosemite (10.10). It runs on Linux. It does not require any Apple artifacts on the system.

# Dependencies

The only  external dependencies of this project are currently:
- [PyExifTool](https://github.com/smarnach/pyexiftool), which in turn requires `exiftool` to be installed.
- [PythonPathValidate](https://github.com/thombashi/pathvalidate) is needed to validate paths names if albums are exported
